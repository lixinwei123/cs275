Summary: Using HTML as client side, I use ajax to make a call to my nodeback end which contains two get functions for calculating factorial and summation of n then sending the result back to the client side.
To use this program, all you need is a working local server, start the file at 
http://localhost:8080/hw3.html to avoid cross origin issues.
